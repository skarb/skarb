# Extending Sexp is required by the Translator. Nearly all Ruby statements have

# attributes to Sexp.

  # value_sexp is a C sexp (a literal, a variable or a call) which stores the
  # value of the actual sexp after evaluation. It should have been named +value+
  # but this method name is unfortunately already taken by RubyParser.
  # value_type is the type of value_sexp. It can either be an instance of a
  # Class or nil in case we cannot determine the exact type.
  # class_type is only used if value_type is Class
